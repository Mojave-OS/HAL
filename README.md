# HAL
The hardware abstraction layer to be used in conjunction with the Mojave-Bike OS. Provides an abstraction for the BCM2711 Perhiphars and the Cortex-A72 Arm Processor.

# What Resources Do We Use?

Below is a list of resources that we are using to build out the HAL. This list is primarily composed of datasheets and specs, but may contain some other repos or libraries donw the road.
